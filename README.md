# Tic Tac Toe

## Description
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a space in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. This implementation features a graphical user interface (GUI) developed from scratch, allowing users to play the game easily and intuitively.

## Planned Features
- **Player vs. Player Mode**: Two players can compete against each other on the same device.
- **Reset Game Option**: Players can easily reset the game to start a new match.
- **Win Detection**: The program detects and announces when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Responsive GUI**: The interface adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience.
**Attempting To Make GUI Interface from Scratch as a motivational project**
